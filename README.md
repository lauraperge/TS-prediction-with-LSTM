# TS-prediction-with-LSTM

### Project in Statistics (Deep Learning) University of Copenhagen

This is a project to forecast the GBPUSD FX rate using recurrent neural network with LSTM.
The goal is to run models of different complexity and then apply different regularization methods to address overfit.
We try to find the best model to predict the test set.
